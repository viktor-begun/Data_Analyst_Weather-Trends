# Udacity_Project_1_Weather_Trends
This is my first project at Udacity. It is very simple, but interesting. It also inspired me to go through the whole Udacity Data Analyst course. The project consisted of making an SQL query to a data-table, making a new table from the SQL outcome, and calculating a moving average. The trasks were done in the enviroment provided by Udacity. Therefore, I present only the .html report. The data on the temperatures were provided by Udacity. If you find any contradiction with other data source, please let me know.

**Prerequisites and used libraries:** none.
