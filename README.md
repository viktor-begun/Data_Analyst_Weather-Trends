# Weather Trends
This is my first project at Udacity. It is very simple, but interesting. It also inspired me to go through the whole Udacity Data Analyst course. The project consisted of making an SQL query to a data-table, making a new table from the SQL outcome, calculating a moving average and correlations. The tasks were done in the enviroment provided by Udacity. Therefore, I present only the `.md` report and `.png` figures. The `.md` file can be seen from GitHub, while the `.html` The data on the temperatures were provided by Udacity. If you find any contradiction with other data source, please let me know.

**Conclusions:** 
- **The world is getting hotter** since at least **from 1950**, or even from 1900.
- Local temperatures in Munich, Warsaw and Kiev are much more volatile, but also show an **increasing temperature trend** in the same period.
- The **warming in Munich is faster** than for the world since 1990.
